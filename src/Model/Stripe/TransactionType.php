     * * Refund failures. If your customerâ€™s bank or card issuer is unable to correctly process a refund
     * (e.g., due to a closed bank account or a problem with the card) Stripe returns the funds to your balance.

     * * Disputes. When a customer disputes a charge, Stripe deducts the disputed amount from your balance.
     * The deduction is represented as a Balance transaction with the type adjustment, where the source object is a dispute.
     * * Dispute reversals. When you win a dispute, the disputed amount is returned to your balance.
